		<h2><font color="green">Project Description</font></h2>
		<p>We created a Frogger program that has a player who is given five lives. 
		Whenever they hit an enemy, they lose a life and are sent back to their starting point. 
		There are three enemies who are the same size, but move at different speeds and directions. 
		The player has to get to the other side to win. When the player has lost all of their lives, 
		the enemies stop moving and the game is over. We used Canopy and GitHub to create this game.</p>

		<h2><font color="green">Project Reflection</font></h2>
		<p>The most challenging part of this project was trying to get the player to return
		to its starting point when it hit an enemy. What I did to solve this problem was put
		a black square directly under the player at its starting point. You cannot see the square
		but this made it much easier for the player to return to an exact position. I got this idea
		from Lab 16 when the rocket had to return to the player. Things I would do differently for
		the project include making enemies that moved up and down and making text appear that said
		when the game was over. I would still make the same project because I am pleased with the final game. 
		I did the project in the to-do list order and I used example code from other projects to complete the program.</p>

		<p>This is the beginning of the game. The three enemies are moving at different speeds and in different directions.
		You have to get to the other side of the game to win. If you get hit by an enemy, you are sent back to the starting point shown here.
		Here are the keys and their corresponding directions for the player's movements.</p>
		<ul><li>W = up</li></ul>
		<ul><li>S = down</li></ul>
		<ul><li>A = left</li></ul>
		<ul><li>D = right</li></ul>

		<p>This is at the end of the game. In the screenshot, you only have one life left. If you get hit by an enemy, the enemies' animation will stop
		and the game will be over. If you survive and get to the other side, you win!</p>

		<p>This section of code sends the player back to the starting position if the player hits an enemy.
		This was the most difficult part of the project and I got it to work by creating a black square that 
		was hidden at the start position. Whenever the player got hit by an enemy, the player was sent to the square's location.
		This was a roundabout way to accomplish my goal, but it still works perfectly.</p>
