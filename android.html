		<p>This is the <a href="MovieTrivia.apk">link</a> to the movie trivia game.</p>

		<h2><font color="blue">Project Description</font></h2>
		<p>Nicki Hilker and I made a movie trivia game where during the first round, the player sees a picture of an actor
		and chooses the actor’s name from four multiple choice answers. The player learns
		if they are correct or incorrect and then they go to the next question. 
		There is a second round where people can match actors to their movies. It is in the same format as Part 1.
		We used MIT App Inventor and iPads to do this project.</p>

		<h2><font color="blue">Kendall's Project Reflection</font></h2>
		<p>The hardest part of this project for me was figuring out how to add more screens and making a button
		that would go from one screen to the next. It was also hard to remember which answer it was when I was
		doing the coding for that particular part. If we’d had more time, we could have made some sort of scoring
		system that would count your correct answers for you. If I could have done something different, I would have 
		added more trivia questions or put in little fun facts about the movies and actors. The easiest part of the 
		project was deciding what to do. Most people know who the actors are and what movies they were in, but they 
		can still have fun playing the game.</p>

		<p>This is the beginning of the game. The player has gotten the question correct, so they want to go to the next question.
		Here is the code that allows screen 1 to switch to screen 2.</p>

		<p>This section of code sends the player to the next screen
		This was the most difficult part of the project and I got it to work by creating a button called 'Next'.
		Whenever the player clicks Next, screen 2 is opened and screen 1 vanishes.
		This allows players to continue playing the game.</p>
